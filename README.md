# 🏡 House Price Prediction

This repository contains a machine learning project for predicting house prices based on various features. The project is implemented using Python in Google Colab.

## 📌 Project Overview

The objective of this project is to build a predictive model that estimates house prices based on input features such as location, size, number of bedrooms, and other relevant attributes.

## 📂 Files in the Repository

- **`House_Price_Prediction.ipynb`**: Jupyter notebook containing data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation steps.
- **`README.md`**: This file provides an overview of the project.

## 📊 Dataset

- The dataset used in this project contains features like:
  - `Location`
